# The Bridge RAMP-UP Project combining HTML5 and CSS3 - by Marc Dilley.

<h3 align="center">A Personal Website</h3>

<p align="center">For this project, I decided to create a mock-up of a website which advertises my services as a web developer in the form of a brand.</p>

## Goals of this project

<ol>
  <li>To learn and put into practice various elements of HTML that might typically be used in a website of this nature.
  <li>To style these elements in a way that is attractive, modern and professional—in the process causing me to research a variety of methods to achieve said goal.
  <li>To showcase my abilities as a web designer in order to comply with the aim of creating a brand that might attract clients.
</ol>

### DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES USED IN THE PROJECT
