            <h1>Education to Tech : My Journey</h1>
            <p>Originally from South London, I have called Spain home since 2012. My journey has led me to explore diverse Spanish cities, such as Sevilla, A Coruña, and my current residence, Valencia. Throughout my professional life, I have been deeply immersed in the field of education, wearing various hats from English teacher to Teacher trainer, and even an Academy director. But, feeling the urge for a fresh challenge, I've set my sights on a career shift as a full-stack developer.</p>
            <p>My background has equipped me with a unique blend of qualities. I possess a keen eye for detail, ensuring precision in whatever I do. I am an effective communicator, and I balance a creative mindset with analytical thinking. These skills have been honed during my educational career, but now, as I embark on this new chapter in full-stack development, I see them as valuable assets that I can bring to the table.
            </p>
            <p>As I transition into the world of full-stack development, I am excited to synthesize my diverse skill set. This shift is not about leaving my past behind but rather leveraging my background in education to complement my problem-solving abilities as a developer. My goal is to offer a fresh and multifaceted perspective to companies and clients alike. In me, you will find a professional who combines the pedagogical finesse of an educator with the technical prowess of a full-stack developer, ready to tackle challenges and deliver innovative solutions.</p>
