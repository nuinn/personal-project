                        <p>
                            The website you are looking at is a prime example of how HTML and CSS work together to create appealing web designs. HTML sets up the content and structure, while CSS adds the style and aesthetics. CSS makes text, backgrounds, and buttons look good and adapts the site for different screens.</p>
                            <p>The web design knowledge I bring, proves beneficial for clients because it ensures their websites not only look good but also function well. It helps attract and retain visitors, which can lead to more business. Clients can expect user-friendly, visually appealing websites that work seamlessly across devices.</p>

                        <p>The Internet has changed the way we view information, and yet strict standards still exist for our more traditional means of communication. For this project, I was required to use basic CSS functions in order to re-imagine a traditional letter for a more web-based interface.</p>

                            <p>A comprehensive understanding of Flexbox is essential in order to design and manipulate a webpage in line with clients’ specific needs. For this project, I was required to use Flexbox functionality in order to arrange HTML containers to match the specific properties and proportions of world flags. Needless to say, some were more challenging than others!</p>
